(* Implement the join of typing envs, or more precisely of typing env levels.

   Most of the code here is actually concerned with the join of *aliases*
   specifically (keeping track of how names change between the different
   environments), and delegates the actual join of types to the
   [Meet_and_n_way_join] module.

   The join involves multiple environments that are known under different names.
   Within this file, we standardise on the following names:

   - The {b source environment} is the initial value (before the join) of the
   environment that we will extend. This is also called the "definition typing
   env" in join_levels.ml; in the context of [Simplify], this is the environment
   we would use to simplify the handler when not doing a join. This is different
   from the "env at fork" in that the source environment is expected to already
   have definitions for the params (and extra params) of the current handler.

   - The {b target environment} is the final value (after the join) of the
   source environment. This is also called the "handler env" in [Simplify]. This
   environment does not exist until the join is completed, but it is still
   helpful to refer to things that will exist there (those either also exist in
   the source environment, or are existential variables added during the join).

   - The {b joined environments} are each of the individual environments that we
   are joining. In the context of [Simplify], these are the environments at each
   use. The joined environments are uniquely identified (within the current
   join) by an {!Index.t}.

   {1:assumptions Assumptions}

   We make the following assumptions on the input environments.

   {2:scope_of_names Scope of variables and symbols}

   We assume that any name (variable or symbol) defined in the source
   environment is also be defined in all the joined environments.

   Any name defined in the source environment is also necessarily defined in the
   target environment by definition.

   {2:lifted_constants Lifted constants}

   We further assume that any symbol defined in one of the joined environments
   is also defined in the source environment (and hence the target environment).
   In the context of [Simplify], this means that we expect lifted constants from
   the joined environments to have already been inserted into the source
   environment with a suitable type.

   In practice, this means that any of the symbols we manipulate can be assumed
   to exist in both the source environment and in the target environemnt (but
   not in the joined environments, as they could be lifted constants from
   another branch).

   {2:coherent_binding_times Coherent binding times}

   We assume that {b the relative order of variables defined in the source
   environment is preserved across all the joined environments}.

   More precisely, if [a] is defined before (resp. strictly before) [b] in the
   source environment, then [a] is also defined before (resp. strictly before)
   [b] in all of the joined environments. In the context of [Simplify], this
   means that the continuation parameters must be added in the same order in the
   handler and at all uses.

   Note that this assumption does not impose any restriction on the relative
   binding times of variables that don't exist in the source environment, even
   if they exist in all the joined environments.

   This assumption is used in [get_possible_canonical_in_source_env] and allows
   an efficient (linear) implementation of this function. *)

    (* We are interested in computing the join {b incrementally}, so we want to
       ignore the $join(P0, ..., Pn)$ part and only compute the new joined
       equations that involve at least one of the $Δi$.

       This can be done by initializing all join inputs to their previous ($Pi$)
       value, then for each input $i$:

       - Perform a join with $Δi$;

       - Set the input to $Ci$ for the following joins.

       In total, there are $n + 1$ joins, including the join of the previous
       values that we don't want to compute and $n$ incremental joins involving
       one of the $Δi$.

       We can simplify the joins by noticing the following:

       - We can remove any join where $Δi$ is empty

       - Suppose that the first $p$ inputs have an empty $Pi$ (we can always
       sort these first). Then the result of the first $p$ joins is necessarily
       empty, since it involves an empty $Pi$. Note that these are the first $p$
       join {b including the previous join}, so only the first $p - 1$
       incremental joins.

       This means that for any $i$ such that {b either} $Δi$ or $Pi$ is empty,
       the $i$-th input to the [join] is invariant and always equal to $Ci$ (if
       $Pi$ is empty, then all the non-empty joins use either $Ci$ or $Δi$; if
       $Δi$ is empty, then all the non-empty joins use either $Ci$ or $Pi$). For
       these inputs, we can simply initialize the input to $Ci$.

       There is one caveat: usually we are skipping the first join since all
       inputs are equal to their $Pi$ values. But if there is at least one of
       the inputs that has an empty $Pi$ and a non-empty $Δi$, we have already
       skipped this join by initializing that input to $Ci = Δi$ instead, and so
       we must perform join with the initial inputs. *)

module Bindings_in_target_env : sig
  (* This module is only concerned with providing a consistent name to represent
     a set of simples in the joined environments.

     Names in the target environment are either names that exist in the source
     environment, or local variables that are created in the target environment
     but do not exist in the source environment.

     We currently maintain two types of relations between names in the joined
     environment and names in the target environment:

     - Imported variables represent a specific variable in all the joined
     environments where it exists.

     - Existentials represent a specific set of simples in the joined
     environments.

     {b Warning}: Each local variable is defined either as an imported variable
     or as an existential, but imported variables and existentials are not
     necessarily represented by local variables in the target environment: there
     might already be a suitable name in the source environment to represent
     this imported variable or existential.

     For instance, consider that we are doing the join of [x: (= a)] in env 0
     and [x: (= b)] in env 1, where [x] exists in the source environment but not
     [a] and [b]. Then we can use [x] to represent [((0 a) (1 b))], we do not
     have to create a local variable. Note that in the case of imported
     variables, this effectively mean that we can rename variables as we import
     them. *)

           This is fine, however, because we drop any possible information about
           these variables by calling [forget_definition_of_created_variables]

         relevant when doing a nested join (join of env extensions); for a
         toplevel join, [join_aliases] is empty and this does nothing.

         Consider that we first perform the following join (assuming that [x]
         and [y] exist in the source env and all other variables are local to
         their joined env) of:

         x: (= a) ; y: (= a)

         and

         x: (= c)

         and that we later perform in the same context the join of nested
         extensions:

         a: (= d)

         and

         y: (= c)

         We'd like to determine that the join of the extensions is:

         x: (= y)

         If we simply use the incremental join algorithm without taking
         demotions into account, we'll find the join of [y: (= a)] (from the
         outer scope in the left environment) and [y: (= c)] (from the nested
         scope in the right environment) but we don't have a way to determine
         that [x] and [y] are equal without reprocessing the equations on [x]
         (in the outer scope, the canonicals for [x] were [(a, c)] so we
         couldn't even find it from the canonicals of [y] in the inner scope,
         which are [(d, c)]).

         We do this by keeping track of the aliases of [a] in the joined env
         ([x] and [y]), and adding back the corresponding demotions (only for
         the variables that actually have an equation in the extension) to the
         first extension, yielding:

         x: (= a) ; y: (= a) ; a: (= d)

         This will interact with the equation [y: (= c)] from the extension
         scope in the right environment, and with the equation [x: (= c)] from
         the parent scope in the right environment, from which we can deduce the
         equality between [x] and [y].

         Note that if we instead have:

         x: (Block 0 (= a)) ; y: (Block 0 (= a))

         and

         x: (Block 0 (= c))

         at the toplevel and

         a: (= d)

         and

         y: (Block 0 (= c))

         in the extensions, we will create a single existential variable [ac] at
         the toplevel.

         When performing the join of the extensions, we will add the equation
         [ac: (= a)] to the left extension, but we also need to add an equation
         [ac: (= c)] to the outer scope in the right env (see the call to
         [defining_equations_of_existentials] below) in order to reprocess
         [ac]. *)
